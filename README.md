# Joint Pricing and Inventory Optimization

## Project Overview
This project develops a quantitative framework to jointly determine the optimal selling price and production quantity for a product with uncertain demand. By moving beyond the traditional Newsvendor model—which assumes a fixed price—this approach incorporates price elasticity of demand to maximize expected profitability under real-world operational constraints.

The model explicitly accounts for distinct cost structures, including standard production costs, premiums for rush-printing (shortage costs), and penalties for inventory disposal (overage costs).

## Methodology

The analysis proceeds in four distinct stages, leveraging statistical modeling and mathematical optimization:

### 1. Demand Estimation (Linear Regression)
The foundation of the optimization is a data-driven demand function. An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is fitted to historical price-demand data to estimate the relationship:
$D = \beta_0 + \beta_1 p + \epsilon$

* **Elasticity:** The coefficients quantify how sensitive demand is to price changes.
* **Uncertainty Modeling:** The regression residuals ($\epsilon$) are preserved to model day-to-day demand variability that cannot be explained by price alone.

### 2. Scenario Generation
To simulate realistic operating conditions, demand scenarios are generated by combining the predicted mean demand (from the regression model) with the empirical distribution of the residuals. This ensures the optimization accounts for the actual shape and dispersion of historical demand uncertainty rather than assuming a theoretical normal distribution.

### 3. Fixed-Price Baseline (Linear Programming)
As a benchmark, an "Extended Newsvendor" model is formulated as a Linear Program (LP). In this stage, the selling price is held fixed. The solver determines the optimal production quantity ($q$) that maximizes average profit across all simulated scenarios, balancing the cost of underproduction (rush-printing) against the cost of overproduction (disposal).

### 4. Joint Optimization (Quadratic Programming)
The core of the project is a Quadratic Programming (QP) formulation where both Price ($p$) and Quantity ($q$) are decision variables.
* **Quadratic Objective:** Since Revenue = Price $\times$ Demand, and Demand is a linear function of Price, the revenue term becomes quadratic ($p^2$).
* **Optimization:** The model maximizes total expected profit (Average Revenue - Average Cost) subject to linear constraints that define shortages and surpluses for every demand scenario. This identifies the global optimum for the price-quantity pair.

### 5. Sensitivity Analysis (Bootstrap Aggregation)
To assess the robustness of the optimal decision, a Bootstrap analysis is performed. The historical data is resampled with replacement 1,000 times. For each iteration:
* The regression model is re-estimated (new slopes and intercepts).
* The QP is resolved with the new parameters.
This process generates empirical distributions for the optimal price and quantity, quantifying the stability of the recommendations against data noise.
